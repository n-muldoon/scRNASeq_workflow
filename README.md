Single Cell RNA-Seq Workflow - Final Project (BF528)
- Conduct single-cell RNA-Seq analysis and downstream analysis in python via scanpy and Celltypist

  
This notebook replicates the single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. perforrmed by Zhang et al (2023), where they compared gene expression across normal pancreatic tissue, liver metastases, and pancreatic tumors.
